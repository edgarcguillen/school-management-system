1111|Jane Goodall|Primatology|Dame Jane Morris Goodall was born on 3 April 1934. Seen as the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees, Goodall is best known for her 60-year study of social and family interactions of wild chimpanzees since she first went to Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania in 1960, where she witnessed human-like behaviours amongst chimpanzees, including armed conflict.
1112|Dorothy Hodgkin|Chemistry|Dorothy Mary Crowfoot Hodgkin was a Nobel Prize-winning British chemist who advanced the technique of X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of biomolecules, which became essential for structural biology.
1113|Ada Lovelace|Computer Science| was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.
1121|Ann Kiessling|Biology|Kiessling is noted for her discovery of reverse transcriptase activity in normal human cells.[3] This report pioneered the importance of naturally occurring retrovirus sequences in human genes, now thought to be important to the genetic plasticity involved in human evolution and biology.
1122|Barbara Liskov|Computer Science|Barbara Liskov is an American computer scientist who has made pioneering contributions to programming languages and distributed computing. Her notable work includes the development of the Liskov substitution principle which describes the fundamental nature of data abstraction, and is used in type theory (see subtyping) and in object-oriented programming.
1123|Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin|Astrology|Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin was a British-born American astronomer and astrophysicist who proposed in her 1925 doctoral thesis that stars were composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Her groundbreaking conclusion was initially rejected because it contradicted the scientific wisdom of the time, which held that there were no significant elemental differences between the Sun and Earth. Independent observations eventually proved she was correct.
1211|Edith Clarke|Electrical Engineering|Edith Clarke was the first woman to be professionally employed as an electrical engineer in the United States,[1] and the first female professor of electrical engineering in the country.
1222|Eliza Murfey|Mechanical Engineering|Eliza Murfey was an inventor who focused on the mechanics of the railroad. She created a device, called packing, that was used to lubricate a trainâ€™s axles with oil. This helped to reduce derailments caused by seized axles, an important safety innovation.
1233|Emmy Noether|Mathematics|Amalie Emmy Noether was a German mathematician who made many important contributions to abstract algebra. She discovered Noether's First and Second Theorem, which are fundamental in mathematical physics.
2111|Flossie Wong-Staa|Medicine|Flossie Wong-Staal was a Chinese-American virologist and molecular biologist. She was the first scientist to clone HIV and determine the function of its genes, which was a major step in proving that HIV is the cause of AIDS.
2222|Gertrude Belle Elion|Pharmacology|Gertrude "Trudy" Belle Elion was an American biochemist and pharmacologist, who shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with George H. Hitchings and Sir James Black for their use of innovative methods of rational drug design for the development of new drugs.
2333|Giuliana Tesoro|Chemistry|Tesoro made a number of advances in textile processing and organic compounds that improved textile performance for everyday consumers as well as efficiency for manufacturing systems. She developed flame-resistant fibers, designed ways to prevent static accumulation in synthetic fibers, and created improved permanent press properties for textiles.
